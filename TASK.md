# Build your first CRUD API

> 💡 New words are marked in **bold** the first time they appear. Every bold word is explained in the Glossary at the bottom. If a sentence confuses you, check the glossary first — it's probably one word, not the whole idea.

## Goal

Build a small API that manages a to-do list: you can create tasks, read them, update them, and delete them — the four **CRUD** operations. You will see and test your API in a visual page called Swagger UI, and publish everything to GitHub.

## Purpose

In the lecture you watched the request → response loop from the outside. Now you build the server side of it yourself. CRUD is the heartbeat of almost every backend in the world — a social network CRUDs posts, a shop CRUDs orders, FlyRank CRUDs SEO reports. Once you've built CRUD once, every backend you ever meet will feel familiar.

Two habits start here: your data lives only in memory (no database yet — that's next week, and losing your data on restart is a lesson, not a bug), and everything is submitted through GitHub (that's how all work in this program is shared).

Beginners usually overthink this. The whole thing is under 100 lines of code, built in small stages. You never write more than ~15 lines before you can test again.

## The big idea in 60 seconds

Your API is a **server** — a program that waits for requests and sends back responses. It offers several **endpoints**. An endpoint is one "door" into your server, defined by two things:

- a **path** — where the door is, like `/tasks` or `/tasks/3`
- an **HTTP method** — what kind of knock it answers to: `GET` (give me), `POST` (create this), `PUT` (replace this), `DELETE` (remove this)

So `GET /tasks` ("give me all tasks") and `POST /tasks` ("create a task") are two different endpoints, even though the path is the same. The four CRUD operations map onto the methods like this:

| CRUD operation | HTTP method | Example endpoint | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Create | POST | `POST /tasks` | Add a new task |
| Read | GET | `GET /tasks` · `GET /tasks/3` | List all tasks / get task 3 |
| Update | PUT | `PUT /tasks/3` | Change task 3 |
| Delete | DELETE | `DELETE /tasks/3` | Remove task 3 |

That table is the assignment. Everything below just builds it, one row at a time.

## Tools — pick ONE lane

Both lanes build exactly the same API. Pick the language you want to stick with; don't switch mid-assignment.

| | 🟨 JavaScript lane | 🐍 Python lane |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Node.js (free, [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)) | Python 3.10+ (free, [python.org](https://python.org)) |
| Framework | Express — [Hello world](https://expressjs.com) | FastAPI — [First steps](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) |
| Swagger UI | Add with [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express) (Stage 5) | Built in at `/docs` — zero setup |
| Testing your API | curl + browser + [Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io) (all free) | same |
| Publishing | Git + a free [GitHub](https://github.com) account | same |

Not sure? If you liked the JS 101 session, take the JavaScript lane. If Python feels friendlier, take the Python lane — you'll get Swagger for free, which is a nice reward.

## The task — six stages (+ one bonus)

Work stage by stage, in order. Each stage ends with a **checkpoint**: a command you run to prove it works. Commit to Git after every stage (that's your ≥6 commits, honestly earned). If you only finish Stage 3, submit anyway — a working half is worth more than a broken whole.

### Stage 0 — Hello, server (~30 min)

The scene: before a restaurant serves food, the doors have to open.

1. Install your lane's tools (Node or Python — see the W2 resources, section 6).
2. Follow your framework's official hello-world page (linked in the table above) to start a server on **localhost** — Express on **port** 3000, FastAPI on port 8000.
3. Visit it in your browser. You should see your hello message.

**Checkpoint:** `curl -i http://localhost:3000/` (or `:8000/`) returns status code 200 and your message.

**Commit:** `Stage 0: hello server`

### Stage 1 — Your first real endpoint (~45 min)

Every API needs a front door that says what it is.

1. Add the endpoint `GET /` returning JSON that describes your API:

   ```json
   { "name": "Task API", "version": "1.0", "endpoints": ["/tasks"] }
   ```
2. Add `GET /health` returning `{ "status": "ok" }`. Real companies use exactly this endpoint to check a server is alive — you've just built your first professional habit.

**Checkpoint:** both URLs return JSON in the browser and via curl.

**Commit:** `Stage 1: root and health endpoints`

### Stage 2 — Read: list and single task (~1 h)

Now the shelves. Your "database" is just a list in your code.

1. Near the top of your file, create an **in-memory** list of task objects, pre-filled with 3 example tasks. Each task has: `id` (number), `title` (text), `done` (true/false).
2. Add `GET /tasks` — returns the whole list.
3. Add `GET /tasks/:id` (Express) / `GET /tasks/{id}` (FastAPI) — returns one task. The `id` part is a **path parameter**: a piece of the URL that changes.
4. If no task has that id, return **status** 404 with a JSON error: `{ "error": "Task 99 not found" }`. Never return an empty 200 for something that doesn't exist — status codes are how machines read your answers.

**Checkpoint:** `curl -i http://localhost:3000/tasks/1` → 200 + one task · `curl -i http://localhost:3000/tasks/99` → 404 + error JSON.

**Commit:** `Stage 2: read endpoints with 404`

### Stage 3 — Create: POST a new task (~1 h)

A customer walks in with a new order.

1. Add `POST /tasks`. The client sends the new task as JSON in the **request body**:

   ```json
   { "title": "Buy milk" }
   ```
2. Your server: gives it the next free id, sets `done` to `false`, adds it to the list, and returns the created task with status 201 ("Created" — the polite way to say "done, here's your receipt").
3. **Validate** the input: if `title` is missing or empty, return 400 ("Bad Request") with a JSON error saying what's wrong. This is your first business rule — the server never trusts the client.

**Checkpoint:**

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/tasks -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title":"Buy milk"}'
```
returns 201 + the new task, and a second `GET /tasks` shows it in the list. Posting `{}` returns 400.

**Commit:** `Stage 3: create with validation`

### Stage 4 — Update & Delete (~1 h)

Orders change, orders get cancelled.

1. Add `PUT /tasks/:id` — replaces a task's `title` and/or `done` with what's in the request body. Returns the updated task. Unknown id → 404. Empty/invalid body → 400.
2. Add `DELETE /tasks/:id` — removes the task. Return status 204 ("No Content" — success, nothing to say) with an empty body. Unknown id → 404.

🎉 **Stop and notice:** you have built a complete CRUD API. Every backend you'll ever work on is this, wearing more clothes.

**Checkpoint:** create a task, update it, mark it done, delete it, and confirm with `GET /tasks` — all via curl, all with the right status codes (201, 200, 204, 404).

**Commit:** `Stage 4: full CRUD`

### Stage 5 — See it: Swagger UI (~1–1.5 h)

So far you've imagined your API. Now look at it.

**Swagger UI** is a web page that reads a description of your API (an **OpenAPI** file) and turns it into interactive documentation: every endpoint listed, with a "Try it out" button that sends real requests — **curl** with a friendly face.

- 🐍 **Python lane:** open `http://localhost:8000/docs`. It's already there — FastAPI generates it from your code. Add a one-line description to each endpoint (see *First steps*) and watch the page improve.
- 🟨 **JavaScript lane:** install `swagger-ui-express`, write a small `openapi.json` describing your five task endpoints (the package README shows the wiring; *OpenAPI basic structure* explains the file). Serve it at `/docs`. Describing endpoints you already built teaches you more than building them did.

Then, in Swagger UI, without curl: create a task, list tasks, update it, delete it.

**Checkpoint:** `/docs` shows all your endpoints; "Try it out" works for the full CRUD cycle. Take a screenshot for your README.

**Commit:** `Stage 5: Swagger UI`

### Stage 6 — Publish to GitHub (~1 h)

Your work only counts when someone else can run it.

1. Create a public GitHub repo and push your code (your ≥6 stage commits come with it).
2. Write a **README** with: what this is, how to install & run it (one documented command), a table of all endpoints, one pasted `curl -i` output, and your Swagger screenshot.

🗓️ **New to Git?** The basics are all you need here: `init → add → commit → push` — see the W2 resources, §9. And don't worry: next week's live session covers Git & GitHub properly — branches, pull requests, and how teams review work.

**Checkpoint:** a stranger with your README could run your API in under 5 minutes.

**Commit:** `Stage 6: publish and docs` — then push everything.

## ★ Make it yours — optional extras

No database yet — so let's have fun with what memory can do.

None of these are required. Pick whatever sounds fun (creative alternatives welcome):

- **Filtering with query parameters:** `GET /tasks?done=true` returns only finished tasks. A **query parameter** is the part after `?` — filters, not addresses.
- **Search:** `GET /tasks?search=milk` returns tasks whose title contains the word.
- **A stats endpoint:** `GET /stats` → `{ "total": 7, "done": 3, "open": 4 }` — your first taste of the server computing something instead of just storing it.
- **Seed & reset:** `POST /reset` restores the 3 example tasks. Handy for demos — and for the next point.
- **The mortality experiment:** create a few tasks, restart your server, `GET /tasks`. Write two sentences in your README about what happened and why. This observation is the entire reason Week 3 exists.

**Commit (if you build any):** `Extras: <what you added>`

### Stage 7 — Bonus: the AI rematch (~1 h, optional — and the most fun)

You built this API by hand, line by line. Now hire the fastest junior developer on Earth — and review their work.

You did Stages 0–6 by hand for a reason: you now know exactly what "correct" looks like. That knowledge is what turns this stage from a magic show into a code review.

1. **Write the prompt yourself** — this is the real exercise. Without copying text from this document, write your own **prompt** asking an AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini — any) to build the same API. From memory, try to specify everything that matters: language and framework, the five endpoints, status codes, validation rules, in-memory storage, Swagger UI. Describing a system precisely is a core backend skill — you'll meet it again in Week 7's spec-first build.
2. **Generate in quarantine.** Put the AI's code in a separate folder (`ai-version/`) or a branch. Your Stages 0–6 code stays untouched — that is your hand-built submission, and it must stay hand-built.
3. **Run it.** Does it start on the first try? Fire your Stage 4 checkpoint curls at it. Which pass? Which fail?
4. **Diff it.** Compare the AI's code with yours side by side (`git diff --no-index your-file ai-file` works on any two files). Then answer three questions in a short "AI vs me" section of your README:
   - What did the AI do better — and do you understand its version well enough to explain it?
   - What did it get wrong or quietly ignore from your prompt? (A missing 400? A wrong status code? A database you never asked for?)
   - What did your prompt forget to specify — and what did the AI silently decide for you?
5. **One rematch.** Improve your prompt with what you learned, regenerate, and note in one sentence what changed.

The lesson hiding in this stage: an AI's output is exactly as good as your specification — and you could only judge it because you had built the thing yourself first. Both halves of that sentence are your career from now on.

**Checkpoint:** your README has an "AI vs me" section containing your full prompt and at least three concrete differences you found.

**Commit:** `Stage 7: AI vs me` (AI code stays in its own folder/branch).

## Requirements

Done = every box ticked. Each one is checkable in under a minute.

- [ ] Server starts with one documented command on localhost.
- [ ] `GET /tasks`, `GET /tasks/:id`, `POST /tasks`, `PUT /tasks/:id`, `DELETE /tasks/:id` all work — full CRUD on an in-memory list (no database, no files).
- [ ] Correct status codes: 200 reads, 201 create, 204 delete, 400 invalid body, 404 unknown id — each error with a JSON error message.
- [ ] POST and PUT validate input (missing/empty title → 400).
- [ ] Swagger UI at `/docs` lists every endpoint, and the full CRUD cycle works via "Try it out".
- [ ] Public GitHub repo, ≥6 meaningful commits (one per stage), README with run instructions, endpoint table, one `curl -i` output, and the Swagger screenshot.

## Stretch (optional)

- [ ] 🟨 Express lane: generate your OpenAPI spec from code comments with `swagger-jsdoc` (LogRocket tutorial) instead of a hand-written file.
- [ ] Add pagination: `GET /tasks?limit=2&offset=2` — and explain in the README why real APIs never return "everything".
- [ ] Stage 7 — the AI rematch (see above): prompt an AI to build the same API, run it, diff it, and write your "AI vs me" section.

## Resources — bridge the gap

Everything is collected in **W2 — Curated resources**. The critical ones per stage:

- **Stage 0–1:** your lane's official quickstart (resources §6) + Terminal guide.
- **Stage 2–4:** MDN HTTP methods · CRUD ↔ REST explained (Treblle) · the build-along tutorials (resources §6b) · http.cat when a status code confuses you.
- **Stage 5:** resources §7 (Swagger/OpenAPI) — pick your lane's row.
- **Stage 6:** resources §9 (Git & GitHub) + Git & GitHub guide — init → add → commit → push. Next week's live session covers Git & GitHub in depth.

## Glossary

Plain-language definitions of every bold word above. No definition depends on another — read them in any order.

| Word | What it means |
|---|---|
| API | A set of doors a program offers so other programs can talk to it. Your to-do API lets any client create and read tasks by sending requests. |
| Endpoint | One specific door: a path plus a method. `GET /tasks` and `POST /tasks` are two different endpoints. |
| Path | The part of the URL after the domain: in `http://localhost:3000/tasks/3`, the path is `/tasks/3`. |
| HTTP method | The type of action a request asks for: GET (give me), POST (create), PUT (replace), PATCH (change part), DELETE (remove). Also called an HTTP "verb". |
| CRUD | Create, Read, Update, Delete — the four things almost every app does with its data. |
| Server | A program that runs and waits for requests, then answers them. (The word also means the machine it runs on.) |
| Client | Whatever sends the request: a browser, curl, Swagger UI, a mobile app. |
| Request | A message from client to server: "method + path + maybe a body". |
| Response | The server's answer: "status code + headers + usually a body". |
| Request body | The data a client sends inside a request — e.g. the JSON of a new task in a POST. |
| Status code | A 3-digit number in every response saying how it went. 2xx = worked (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content) · 4xx = the client goofed (400 Bad Request, 404 Not Found) · 5xx = the server goofed. |
| JSON | The text format APIs use for data: `{ "title": "Buy milk", "done": false }`. Easy for humans to read, easy for machines to parse. |
| localhost | Your own computer's address. `http://localhost:3000` = "the server running on this machine, port 3000". Nobody else can see it. |
| Port | A numbered doorway on a machine, so many programs can listen at once. Express commonly uses 3000, FastAPI 8000. |
| In-memory | Data kept in your program's variables (a list in the code). Fast and simple — but gone when the program stops. Databases exist to fix exactly this. |
| Path parameter | A changing piece of the path: the `3` in `/tasks/3`. Written `:id` (Express) or `{id}` (FastAPI) in your code. |
| Query parameter | Extra options after `?` in the URL: `/tasks?done=true&search=milk`. Used for filtering and searching, not for identifying a resource. |
| Validate / validation | Checking incoming data before trusting it (is title there? is it text?). The server never assumes the client behaved. |
| Framework | A box of pre-solved problems (routing, JSON parsing, responses) so you only write your own logic. Express and FastAPI are frameworks. |
| Swagger UI | A web page that displays your API as interactive documentation, with a "Try it out" button that sends real requests. |
| OpenAPI | The standard file format (JSON or YAML) that describes an API — its endpoints, inputs and responses. Swagger UI reads this file. FastAPI writes it for you; in Express you write it yourself. |
| curl | A terminal program that sends HTTP requests. `curl -i URL` shows the status code and headers too. |
| Git / GitHub / repo / commit | Git tracks versions of your code in a repository; a commit is one saved step with a message; GitHub hosts your repo online so others can see it. |
| README | The front page of a repo: what this is, how to run it, how to use it. |
| Route | Another word for an endpoint definition in your code — frameworks call the code that answers an endpoint a "route" or "route handler". |
| Prompt | The instructions you give an AI assistant. In Stage 7 your prompt is a mini-specification: the more precisely it names endpoints, status codes and rules, the closer the output lands to your API. |
| Diff | A line-by-line comparison of two versions of code, showing what was added, removed or changed. `git diff` produces one; reading diffs is how professionals review each other's work. |
